Many of these functions are still untested, but should work. My intention with this package has been to streamline the workflow required for getting the understory models for FSVM. 
Wherever I have been able, I have embedded static data files (shapefiles, python scripts, etc.) as system files within the package so they can be easily called from any machine.
Included is what I have completed so far. I intend to add at least three more functions: 
* assignLPI for adding sample points along an LPI survey line
* assignCover for buffering the sampled field plot around the survey location
* getLpiCov for formatting new LPI or Cover Polt surveys and possibly appending to a current data file

Note: since I've been mainly concerned with streamlining the modeling process, I have mostly elected to ignore IFWIS species classification and data exporting procedures.
However, I can easily add these into the package if it is something we still need to be concerned with maintaining. 


I welcom any feedback or input.
